# Drive_Awake-Great-minds-4


![](demo.png)

## intro
Green Light Association has a study shows that 80% of the drivers confess they drive tired
Maariv Study shows that 20% of the accidents was because fatigue - the results are the same all over the world.
In Israel, one person is killed per day by average .


## Goal
We have go a challenge from Elbit Systemsâ„¢ to create a system 
alerts  drivers when they fall asleep during driving.

## Solution
Our team has designed and developed an artificial intelligence based system that detects the driver's fatigue level in real time (using camere,infrared camera,ultrasonic sensors)  and alerts it .
In addition, as soon as the driver closes his eyes due to fatigue, the system wakes up immediately (vocal and visual)
the driver wakes up - human life is saved.

In the decision of the group members it was decided not to share the code.

we have used:

#artificial intelligence based system code (Python,openCV).

#serial comunication.

#Arduino (C/C++).

#Camere and infrared camera.

#Ultrasonic sensors.

#LCD Panel
